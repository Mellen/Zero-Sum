		<h1>Zero Sum Help</h1>
		<div>
		<h2>Objective</h2>
		<p>The aim of Zero Sum is to create rows or columns of numbers that add up to 0.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
		<h2>Gameplay</h2>
		<div>
		<h3>Control</h3>
		<p>The game is played with the left and right cursor keys and the space bar.<p>
		<ul>
			<li>The cursor keys move the falling number left and right</li>
			<li>The sace bar makes the falling number drop as far as it can almost immediately</li>
		</ul>
		<p>You can pause and unpause the game at any point, with the pause and unpause buttons. You can also restart the game with the restart button.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
		<h3>Scoring</h3>
		<p>When a continuous vertical or horizontal set of two or more numbers adds up to zero then those numbers will disappear and your score will increase.</p>
		<p>The score is calculated according ot how many numbers are eliminated in one go. 2 numbers gets you 1 point, 3 get you 3 points, 4 gets you 6, 5 gets you 10 points, and so on.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
		<h3>Difficulty</h3>
		<p>The zeroth level of the game is very easy to play. In fact you don't even have to touch the keyboard to get through it.</p>
		<p>After the zeroth level the numbers start falling a little faster and there is a chance that a block will fall. Blocks cannot be used to form zero sums, but they do dissappear after an amount of time.</p>
		<p>The higher your level, the faster the numbers fall and the longer the blocks stay for.</p>
		<p>You gain a level for every 70 numbers cleared.</p>
